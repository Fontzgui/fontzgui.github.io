## What Makes Top 5%

### Top 5% Profiles Have:

1. **Specific, Verifiable Achievements**
   - Not: "Improved security"
   - Yes: "28 STRIDE threats documented, found gaps through validation, fixed all before launch"

2. **Clear Value Proposition**
   - Not: "Passionate about AI security"
   - Yes: "I understand security as continuous program: architect → validate → fix → maintain"

### About Section (2,600 chars)

**Structure:**
1. Opening hook (what you do)
2. Proof point (specific example)
3. Key achievement (measurable outcome)
4. What this demonstrates (skills breakdown)
5. Approach/philosophy (how you think)
6. Call to action (what you're looking for)

**Recommended text:**

```
I build secure AI systems by combining security expertise with AI-assisted development—and I validate everything.

When building DreamVelo, I architected with security in mind from day one: zero-trust design, no exposed secrets, authentication at every layer. I directed AI implementation with these requirements built into every prompt.

Then I did what security professionals do: I validated. Formal STRIDE threat modeling documented 28 potential threats—and revealed vulnerabilities my initial architecture had missed. I fixed them all before launch.

The result: Production AI platform deployed across web and mobile with zero security incidents.

What this demonstrates:

• Security-informed architecture (not bolted on later)
• AI direction capability (security requirements in prompts, 10,000+ lines generated)
• Validation discipline (found my own gaps through formal analysis)
• Remediation follow-through (fixed everything before ship)
• Operations mindset (ongoing logging/monitoring, threat assessment, incident response)

I understand security as a continuous program: architect → implement → validate → fix → maintain. This is how you move fast with AI while maintaining security rigor.

Currently seeking AI Security Engineer, AI Product Manager, or Technical Customer Success roles at leading AI companies.

Portfolio: https://fontzgui.github.io
Location: Atlanta, Georgia (Open to remote)
```

**Why this works:**
- **Opening**: Clear value proposition, unique angle ("and I validate everything")
- **Proof**: Specific example (DreamVelo), concrete actions
- **Achievement**: Measurable (28 threats, zero incidents)
- **Demonstrates**: Breaks down what achievement proves about skills
- **Philosophy**: Shows mature thinking ("security is continuous program")
- **CTA**: Clear about what you want, easy to contact

**What NOT to say:**
- ❌ "Passionate about security" (vague)
- ❌ "10+ years experience" (age discrimination risk)
- ❌ "Team player, hard worker" (everyone says this)
- ❌ "Seeking challenging opportunities" (generic)

## LinkedIn Activity Strategy

### Profile Views

**Goal:** Increase profile views from recruiters at target companies

**How:**
1. **Update profile completely** (triggers algorithm boost)
2. **Post once/week** (increases visibility)
3. **Engage with AI security content** (LinkedIn shows you to similar people)
4. **Connect with recruiters** at target companies

**What to post:**
- Portfolio launch announcement (see sample below)
- AI security insights (share articles with your take)
- DreamVelo updates (new features, learnings)
- Industry news commentary

**How often:**
- 1 post per week (minimum)
- 3-4 posts per week (optimal)
- Daily (too much unless you're influencer)

### Sample Portfolio Launch Post

```
I'm excited to share my portfolio showcasing how AI-first development can be as secure as traditional development when architected correctly.

Over 6 months, I built DreamVelo to demonstrate the approach:

✅ Security-informed architecture from day one (zero-trust, defense in depth)
✅ Directed AI implementation with security requirements (10,000+ lines generated)
✅ Formal STRIDE threat modeling revealed gaps I'd missed—fixed all before launch
✅ Zero security incidents in production

The key lesson: Security isn't a phase—it's continuous. Architect with security in mind, validate formally to find gaps, fix everything, maintain ongoing operations.

This is how you ship fast with AI while maintaining security rigor.
