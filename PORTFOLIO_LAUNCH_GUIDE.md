## LinkedIn Profile Optimization

### Overview: What Makes Top 5%

**Top 5% profiles have:**
1. **Specific, verifiable achievements** - Not vague claims
2. **Clear value proposition** - What you bring to employer
3. **Professional credibility** - Story that holds up under scrutiny
4. **Strategic positioning** - Stands out from generic profiles

**What to avoid:**
- ❌ Buzzwords without substance ("passionate", "innovative", "rockstar")
- ❌ Vague accomplishments ("improved security", "worked on AI")
- ❌ Inflated claims that don't match experience
- ❌ Generic job descriptions

### 3. About Section (2,600 characters max)

**Copy this exactly:**

```
I build secure AI systems by combining security expertise with AI-assisted development—and I validate everything.

When building DreamVelo, I architected with security in mind from day one: zero-trust design, no exposed secrets, authentication at every layer. I directed AI implementation with these requirements built into every prompt.

Then I did what security professionals do: I validated. Formal STRIDE threat modeling documented 28 potential threats—and revealed vulnerabilities my initial architecture had missed. I fixed them all before launch.

The result: Production AI platform deployed across web and mobile with zero security incidents.

What this demonstrates:

• Security-informed architecture (not bolted on later)
• AI direction capability (security requirements in prompts, 10,000+ lines generated)
• Validation discipline (found my own gaps through formal analysis)
• Remediation follow-through (fixed everything before ship)
• Operations mindset (ongoing logging/monitoring, threat assessment, incident response)

I understand security as a continuous program: architect → implement → validate → fix → maintain. This is how you move fast with AI while maintaining security rigor.

Currently seeking AI Security Engineer, AI Product Manager, or Technical Customer Success roles at leading AI companies.

**Sample post:**

```
I'm excited to share my portfolio showcasing how AI-first development can be as secure as traditional development when architected correctly.

Over 6 months, I built DreamVelo to demonstrate the approach:

✅ Security-informed architecture from day one (zero-trust, defense in depth)
✅ Directed AI implementation with security requirements (10,000+ lines generated)
✅ Formal STRIDE threat modeling revealed gaps I'd missed—fixed all before launch
✅ Zero security incidents in production

The key lesson: Security isn't a phase—it's continuous. Architect with security in mind, validate formally to find gaps, fix everything, maintain ongoing operations.

This is how you ship fast with AI while maintaining security rigor.

Check out the full case study and 5-step framework: https://fontzgui.github.io

Open to AI Security Engineer, AI Product Manager, or Technical Customer Success roles at leading AI companies.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm applying for the [Job Title] role at [Company]. I specialize in secure AI development—combining security expertise with AI implementation capability.

Recently, I built DreamVelo to prove AI-first development can be as secure as traditional development. I architected with security in mind, directed AI to generate 10,000+ lines of production code, then performed formal STRIDE threat modeling that revealed vulnerabilities I'd missed. I fixed them all before launch. Result: Zero security incidents in production.

What I bring to [Company]:
• Security-informed architecture (zero-trust, defense in depth)
• AI direction capability (security requirements in prompts)
• Validation discipline (formal analysis, adversarial testing)
• Operations mindset (ongoing security program, not checkbox)

I understand security as continuous: architect → validate → fix → maintain. This is how teams can ship fast with AI while maintaining security rigor.

I'd love to discuss how I can help [Company] build secure AI products at scale.

Portfolio: https://fontzgui.github.io

Best regards,
Guillaume Fontz
